1. Training set:

Positive and negative tweets provided by nltk's twitter_samples corpus are used in order to train a Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier.
After trials on different kinds of classifiers, this model was chosen as the best performer. Multinomial Naive Bayes model was not 
chosen due to the fact that both the training and application datasets consisted of short texts.

2. Features:

After exploratory analysis on the training dataset, document frequency parameters were determined and domain specific stopwords such as
"follow" were removed. This decreased the noise in the training dataset.

3. Results:

In the 10-fold cross-validation step, the model achieved an average accuracy of 75.1%. Mean squared error was 0.172 and the area under the
